              <p class="mt-4">Hi there! I'm Luis Villasmil, a dedicated UX Designer passionate about crafting
                engaging digital
                experiences. My focus is on Interaction Design (IxD) and Interface Design, complemented with WCAG 2
                accessibility standards, where I combine agile methodologies and UX knowledge with a strong attention to
                detail.
                <br>
                <br>
                I enjoy creating intuitive and visually appealing solutions that enhance how people interact with
                digital
                products and services. I value collaboration and stay updated on industry trends to ensure I deliver the
                best possible results for users.

          </div>
          <div class="col col-lg">
            <p>My journey in UX started gradually, but my passion for digital experiences quickly emerged, leading me to
              dive into web design early in my career. This experience opened my eyes to the dynamic world of technology
              and ignited my interest in creating seamless user experiences. Along the way, I've had the privilege of
              learning from talented mentors, mastering the art of building applications and websites using various
              frameworks.

              As I delved into front-end coding, I gained valuable insights into what's achievable and how to enhance
              user experiences. In my recent roles, I've not only applied my knowledge but also continued to learn,
              staying updated on new technologies and methodologies. I've always prioritized accessibility in every
              project, striving to create inclusive experiences that cater to diverse needs.
              <br><br>
              Moreover, I'm deeply invested in understanding user and business requirements, applying industry standards
              and best practices to my design decisions. My work has spanned projects for renowned companies across
              Latin America and the world, including Falabella, Salvation Army, Santander, Walmart, and more.
              Additionally, my experience at Comscore has been particularly rewarding, where I've contributed to
              projects like Proximic and TV, among others. These opportunities have allowed me to deepen my
              understanding of user needs and business objectives across various industries, further honing my skills in
              creating impactful digital experiences. I believe in basing design choices on solid data, ensuring that
              each project aligns with both user expectations and business goals, while adhering to industry standards
              to deliver exceptional user experiences.
