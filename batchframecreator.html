            <div><h4>About this project</h4><p>As the sole creator and developer of the Batch Frame Creator plugin, I, Luis Villasmil, undertook a personal project to address a common pain point encountered in UI/UX design: the laborious task of manually creating multiple frames in Figma. This case study delves into my end-to-end involvement in the project, emphasizing the user-centric approach, integration of WCAG principles, and innovative utilization of AI in the development process.</p></div><div><h4>Problem Statement</h4><p>
            Based on my own experiences and feedback from friends/colleagues, I identified a significant challenge in maintaining efficiency and consistency when creating numerous frames for design projects. Manual creation processes were prone to errors and could significantly slow down the design workflow, hindering creativity and productivity.
            
            </p></div>
            <div><h4>Goals</h4><p><li>Efficiency: Streamline the process of creating multiple frames to save valuable time for designers.</li>
            
            <li>Consistency: Ensure uniformity across frames to maintain design coherence and integrity.</li>
            
            <li>Accessibility: Design the plugin interface with WCAG principles to ensure inclusivity and accessibility for all users.</li>
            
            <li>Innovation: Leverage AI technology to facilitate the coding process and enhance overall plugin functionality.</li>
            </p></div>
            <div><h4 class="my-4">Design and Development Process</h4><p><h5 class="mb-4">Understanding User Needs</h5><p>Based on personal experiences and feedback from friends/colleagues, I identified pain points and requirements related to frame creation.
            
            Determined key features and functionalities essential for a streamlined frame creation process.</p>
            
            <h5 class="mb-4"> Iterative Design and Prototyping</h5><p>
            Created wireframes and prototypes based on my understanding of user needs and design preferences.
            
            Iterated on designs based on personal insights and feedback from friends/colleagues to enhance usability and intuitiveness.</p><h5 class="mb-4">Application of WCAG Principles</h5>
            
            Ensured the plugin interface adhered to WCAG 2.0 guidelines for accessibility, drawing from personal knowledge and research.
            
            Prioritized features such as keyboard navigation, color contrast, and screen reader compatibility.
            
            <h5 class="mb-4">Integration of AI Technology</h5>
            
            Leveraged AI tools to automate coding tasks, optimize performance, and enhance the user experience, based on personal experimentation and exploration.
            
            Used generative AI to suggest design layouts and streamline development processes, drawing from personal insights and experimentation.</p></div>
