              <h4>About this project</h4>
              <p>As the sole creator and developer of the Batch Frame Creator plugin, I undertook a personal project to address a common pain point in UI/UX design: the laborious task of manually creating multiple frames in Figma. This case study explores my end-to-end involvement, emphasizing a user-centric approach, integration of WCAG principles, and innovative use of AI in the development process.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
              <p>Based on personal experiences and feedback from colleagues, I identified a significant challenge in maintaining efficiency and consistency when creating numerous frames for design projects. Manual creation processes were prone to errors and could significantly slow down the design workflow, hindering creativity and productivity.</p>

            <section>
              <h4>Goals</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Efficiency: Streamline the process of creating multiple frames to save valuable time for designers.</li>
                <li>Consistency: Ensure uniformity across frames to maintain design coherence and integrity.</li>
                <li>Accessibility: Design the plugin interface with WCAG principles to ensure inclusivity and accessibility for all users.</li>
                <li>Innovation: Leverage AI technology to facilitate the coding process and enhance overall plugin functionality.</li>
              </ul>

              <h5 class="mb-4">Understanding User Needs</h5>
              <p>I identified pain points and requirements related to frame creation based on personal experiences and feedback from colleagues. This helped determine key features and functionalities essential for a streamlined frame creation process.</p>
              
              <h5 class="mb-4">Iterative Design and Prototyping</h5>
              <p>I created wireframes and prototypes based on my understanding of user needs and design preferences. The designs were iterated based on personal insights and feedback to enhance usability and intuitiveness.</p>
              
              <h5 class="mb-4">Application of WCAG Principles</h5>
              <p>I ensured the plugin interface adhered to WCAG 2.0 guidelines for accessibility, drawing from personal knowledge and research. Priority was given to features such as keyboard navigation, color contrast, and screen reader compatibility.</p>
              
              <h5 class="mb-4">Integration of AI Technology</h5>
              <p>I leveraged AI tools to automate coding tasks, optimize performance, and enhance the user experience. Generative AI was used to suggest design layouts and streamline development processes, based on personal insights and experimentation.</p>
